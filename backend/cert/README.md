# Certificate directory

When testing, please place your TLS certificates here.
You can generate them with the scripts in `../certscript`.

You'll need a root certificate, private key etc. to create
a working chain of trust. You can generate both keys with `makekey.sh`.

Certificate => cert.pem
Public key  => ckey.pem
